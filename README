HTMAPL: HyperText Geographic Maps for jQuery

HTMAPL is:
* An basic HTML vocabulary for describing both interactive and static geographic
  maps, with layers and markers
* A Polymaps-inspired--but rendering engine-agnostic--interface for generating
  geographic maps in JavaScript
* A jQuery plugin that ties together these two concepts, making it
	frighteningly easy to make web-native geographic maps
